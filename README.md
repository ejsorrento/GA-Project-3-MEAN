# GA-Project-3-MEAN

You never know when inspiration will strike. With Diddy, you'll never lose another great idea again. Simply press record and use the interactive piano to immortalize your melody, riff or tune for quick and easy access.

Diddy is a single-page application that leverages the MEAN stack to allow users to create, edit and play back their original songs.

Diddy hosts a library of piano samples spanning one octave. It records songs by mapping note and keypress-duration pairs to an array, which is stored in MongoDB. Songs are played back by looping through this array and calling each note in the sequence for the duration it was originally played.

You can practice your songs on the responsive piano, and record them once they're perfected. Save your diddies and contribute to a vibrant community of dedicated artists worldwide.
